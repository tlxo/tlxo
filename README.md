- 👋 Hi, I’m @tlxo, which is short for **t**oni **l**aa**xo**, which in turn is a gentle bastardization of my name. 
- 👀 I’m interested all kinds of good music, uncompromising user experiences, and the web as a medium.
- 🛠️ I work with web accessibility, helping developers craft inclusive interfaces, and their managers to see why it is essential.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to build static websites with Eleventy and brushing up on my Swift skills.
- 📫 You can reach me via email at *hello at tlxo dot fi*.
