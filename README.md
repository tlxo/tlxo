- 👋 Hi, I’m @tlxo (or *Toni Laakso* if you're into more traditional ways of spelling).
- 👀 I’m interested in [all kinds of good music](https://amerikanpeikko.bandcamp.com), the web as a medium, and uncompromising user experiences regardless of the context. 
- 🛠️ I work with web accessibility, helping developers and designers build inclusivity, and their managers to see why it is essential.
- 📫 You can reach me personally at [totallynotarobot at lxo dot fi](mailto:t@lxo.fi) and professionally at [toni dot laakso at eficode dot com](mailto:toni.laakso@eficode.com).
